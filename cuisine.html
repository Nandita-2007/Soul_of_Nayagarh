                <p class="cuisine-description">
                    Chhena Poda, meaning “burnt cheese,” is a famous sweet from Odisha, and a specialty of Nayagarh. It is made from fresh cottage cheese (chhena) mixed with sugar, semolina, and cardamom, then baked slowly until it develops a rich, caramelized crust. The result is a soft, melt-in-the-mouth dessert with a sweet, slightly smoky flavor. Often prepared during festivals and special occasions, Chhena Poda is a perfect example of Odisha’s traditional culinary art and is cherished by locals and visitors alike.
