                    <h2>Pattachitra of Nayagarh</h2>
                    <p>Pattachitra is a traditional painting style of Odisha, and in Nayagarh it holds a special place in the district’s artistic identity. These paintings are created on cloth or dried palm leaves using natural colors made from minerals and plants. The themes usually depict stories from the Ramayana, Mahabharata, Jagannath culture, and folk tales. Artists use bold lines, intricate detailing, and vibrant colors like red, yellow, indigo, and white to bring the stories to life. In Nayagarh, Pattachitra is not only a form of art but also a medium to preserve mythology, devotion, and cultural heritage, passed down through generations of skilled painters.</p>
