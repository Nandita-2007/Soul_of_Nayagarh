                <h2>Danda Nata (Danda Jatra Dance)</h2>
                <p>Danda Nata is a ritualistic dance-drama performed mainly during the month of Chaitra (March–April). It is dedicated to Lord Shiva and Goddess Kali. The performers, known as Danduas, undergo strict discipline, fasting, and penance before the performance. The dance includes vigorous body movements, acrobatics, devotional songs, and enactments of mythological stories. It represents the victory of good over evil and is both religious and theatrical in nature.</p>

                <h2>Chhau Dance</h2>
                <p>Chhau is a semi-classical dance form with elements of martial arts, acrobatics, and folk traditions. While it is most famous in Mayurbhanj and Keonjhar, it is also performed in parts of Nayagarh during festivals. Dancers wear colorful masks, carry weapons, and enact stories from the Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Puranas. The energetic steps, leaps, and war-like movements make Chhau visually striking.</p>

                <h2>Prahallada Nataka (Unique to Nayagarh)</h2>
                <p>Prahallada Nataka is one of the most famous traditional folk theatre forms that originated in Nayagarh in the 19th century under the patronage of Raja Bagha Singh. It narrates the story of Bhakta Prahlada, a devout follower of Lord Vishnu, who stood against the tyranny of his father, demon king Hiranyakashipu. The drama is performed with elaborate costumes, traditional music, and expressive dance movements. What makes it unique is its all-night performance style, where actors sing, dance, and act simultaneously, creating a powerful devotional atmosphere.</p>
